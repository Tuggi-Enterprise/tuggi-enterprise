/**
 * CNPJ — alphanumeric, in the shape it has had from 31/07/2026 onwards.
 *
 * Port of the reference implementation published by Serpro
 * (https://github.com/serpro-repos/CNPJ-Alfa-Calc-DV, `src/typescript/cnpj.ts`,
 * consulted 2026-08-14), which implements Instrução Normativa RFB nº 2.229/2024.
 * The algorithm is NOT rewritten from memory: the weights, the ASCII base and the
 * `< 2 → 0` rule of the modulo 11 are the reference's, and `CNPJ_REFERENCE_VECTORS`
 * below is the reference's own test list, kept so a future edit that "simplifies"
 * the loop fails loudly.
 *
 * It arrived here with the partnership proposal (#396), which moved out of the CMS.
 * `tuggi-cms/lib/validation/cnpj.ts` is the same port and stays there for the
 * conference screen and the promotion: the two ends read the same value out of
 * `partner.partner_form_submissions.answers`, so they may not disagree about what a
 * valid CNPJ is. The contract that binds them is
 * `docs/contracts/partner-proposal-answers.md`.
 *
 * What changes versus the old numeric CNPJ, and why every shortcut breaks:
 *
 * - Positions 1–12 accept `[A-Z0-9]`; only the two check digits stay numeric. So
 *   `^\d{14}$`, `type="number"` and `inputmode="numeric"` reject a valid company —
 *   and pass every test written with pre-2026 data.
 * - Each character is worth its ASCII code minus 48, so `0`–`9` keep their old
 *   value (that is what makes the algorithm backwards compatible) and `A` = 17,
 *   `B` = 18, and so on.
 *
 * Lowercase: the reference refuses it. This module refuses it too in `isValidCnpj`,
 * and `normalizeCnpj` is the documented, single place where a typed `abc` becomes
 * `ABC` — the form upper-cases as the person types (spec do `design`
 * spec-parceria-formulario-e-contrato-2026-08, §3.2), so validation never sees
 * lowercase in practice, and a caller that skips normalisation gets the strict
 * behaviour rather than a silent guess.
